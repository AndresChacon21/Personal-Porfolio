What I learned:

        * I learned the basic behavior/errors of HTML5.
        * I learned the functionality of the <body> and <head> tags.
        * I learned how to set up a basic structure in HTML. Also, the good practices and how to properly use tags to structure my website.
        * I learned how to make a navigation bar, add images, add svg icons, add lorem ipsum text to have a preview of the website.
        * I learned the importance of documenting my code to make the process easier (I must take in consideration that Iâ€™m working by myself; I need experience is a team project scenario).
    CSS
        * I learned the basic components of CSS.
        * I learned the different ways to code CSS (BEM, Utility First, Modules).
        * I learned the basic behavior/errors of CSS.
        * I learned how to use different types of selectors (universal, element, class, id, attribute).
        * I learned how to combine selectors.
        * I learned how to use pseudo-class selectors.
        * I learned the concept of specificity.
        * I learned how to change color, size, shape, manipulate text, images, sections and more.
        * I learned about the different display options and how to manipulate the content inside of them.
        * I learned about the concept of responsive web design.

What I coded: 
    * Costume nav bar with hover effects.
    * Image as background of a section, with additional elements on top.
    * Display 3 elements in a section using grid display.
    * I style a basic form.

My observations:
    This project made me realize that I've been coding websites wrong all my life. I learned a lot and at the same time I have so a lot of questions.
    I thinks a made progress but I need to take in consideration other skills, such as: usings commands to code faster, getting familiar with the industry and
    improve my mechanical skills and knowledge.

    I not a fan off the desing but its okay for my first project using only CSS and HTML5
